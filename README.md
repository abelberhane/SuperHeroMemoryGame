# SuperHero Memory Game

Fun Superhero memory game developed in C#. This project relied heavily on being able to manipulate the picture boxes and 
removing them once they match. Utilizing the picture boxes was easy and the logic behind the timer was interesting. The game 
is simple and the idea can be beaten but I could not imagine what would happen if the images were more closely aligned and I was able to 
add more and more picture boxes!
